***C - Dynamic libraries***

* It is the second project about libraries.

* The first project - Project 0x09 - was about static libraries.

* Static libraries are libraries that are directly included in an executable file.

* They have the advantage of speed when the functions inside are called.

* Their drawbacks are a increase in the weight of executable and obligation of recompilling all the program for any updates in the library

* Dynamic libraries are not directly included in the executable file, only their memory adress is.

* This solve the problem of weight and update follow up.

* The libraries can be updated without recompillling all the program as their are not included inside.

* It can be a bit slower than Static libraries though.

***Go for code!***
